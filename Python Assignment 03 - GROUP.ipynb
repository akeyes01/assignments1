    "# **Assignment 03: Collaborative “Team Inventory Manager”**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "You and your team will create a **simple, text-based “Inventory Manager”** application composed of seven modules—**one module per student**. The final program allows users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add items** to an inventory.  \n",
    "2. **Remove items** by name.  \n",
    "3. **Update item quantities**.  \n",
    "4. **Search for items** by name or partial name.  \n",
    "5. **View inventory statistics** (e.g., total items, sum of quantities).  \n",
    "6. **Save/Load** the inventory to/from a file.  \n",
    "7. **Exit** when done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Goal**: Practice both **teamwork** and **basic Python** development. You’ll decide on the data structure(s), function signatures, and how you collaborate—**all tracked via Git**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Git Collaboration: Step-by-Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create/Initialize the Repository**  \n",
    "   - Pick one team member (e.g., Student #7 who’s responsible for `main_app.py`) to create the GitHub repo.  \n",
    "   - Configure the repo with a `README.md` that briefly outlines the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clone & Branch**  \n",
    "   - Each of you clones the repo to your local machine.  \n",
    "   - Create a **feature branch** for your assigned module (e.g., `feature/validator` for `validator.py`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agree on Basic Project Structure**  \n",
    "   - Decide as a group on:\n",
    "     - The data structure (e.g., `dict` vs. list of dicts) used for the inventory.\n",
    "     - How functions will receive and return data (e.g., return booleans vs. raise exceptions).\n",
    "     - Which file format you’ll use for saving/loading (text, CSV, JSON, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement Your Module**  \n",
    "   - Work **only** in your feature branch.  \n",
    "   - Add your module file (e.g., `validator.py`) and implement the required functions.  \n",
    "   - Commit **frequently** (“commit early, commit often”) with clear commit messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test & Document**  \n",
    "   - **Locally** test your module in isolation (e.g., using `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` blocks).  \n",
    "   - Write docstrings/comments for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pull Request & Code Review**  \n",
    "   - Once your module is “ready to share,” push your branch to GitHub.  \n",
    "   - Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the main branch (or a “develop” branch if you decide to use one).  \n",
    "   - A teammate reviews your code; you address any feedback, then merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Integration & Final Testing**  \n",
    "   - After all modules are merged, Student #7 (or the whole team) integrates them in `main_app.py`.  \n",
    "   - Perform full-application tests to confirm everything works smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Finalize & Present**  \n",
    "   - Ensure your GitHub repo has all final code.  \n",
    "   - Prepare your demonstration: each student explains their module’s purpose and shows how it integrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Detailed Guidance per Module**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are suggestions for **function names** and **responsibilities**. You do **not** have to follow these exactly; your team can adjust as needed. However, please keep the spirit of the modules separate—this helps you learn modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module A: `input_manager.py` (Student #1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Centralize all **user-input** logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`get_main_menu_choice()`**  \n",
    "   - **Prompt** the user for a menu choice (1: Add, 2: Remove, … 8: Exit).  \n",
    "   - Use a loop to **re-prompt** on invalid input.  \n",
    "   - **Return** a valid integer (or string) for the menu selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`get_item_details()`**  \n",
    "   - **Ask** for an item name and a quantity.  \n",
    "   - Convert quantity to `int` if you like, or return it as a string for `validator.py` to handle.  \n",
    "   - **Return** `(item_name, quantity)` as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`get_search_term()`**  \n",
    "   - **Prompt** for a search string/keyword.  \n",
    "   - **Return** that string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Keep prompts **clear and consistent** (e.g., “Enter a menu option [1-8]: ”).\n",
    "- In your `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, write quick tests like:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "      choice = get_main_menu_choice()\n",
    "      print(\"You chose:\", choice)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Optional Challenge**: Add an option to confirm user input or handle special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module B: `validator.py` (Student #2)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Validate user inputs for correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`validate_item_name(name)`**  \n",
    "   - Check if `name` is **not empty**.  \n",
    "   - Optionally check for invalid characters.  \n",
    "   - Return something like `(True, \"\")` if valid, `(False, \"Error message\")` if invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`validate_quantity(qty)`**  \n",
    "   - Check if `qty` is an integer ≥ 0 (no negative quantities).  \n",
    "   - Return `(True, \"\")` if valid, `(False, \"Error message\")` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Decide **as a team** how you’ll handle error messaging. Some teams prefer exceptions; others prefer returning `(bool, msg)`.  \n",
    "- **Test** your validator with sample inputs:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "      print(validate_item_name(\"  \"))  # Expect False\n",
    "      print(validate_item_name(\"Apple\"))  # Expect True\n",
    "      print(validate_quantity(-5))  # Expect False\n",
    "      print(validate_quantity(10))  # Expect True\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Optional Challenge**: Add more checks (e.g., maximum length of item name).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module C: `inventory_operations.py` (Student #3)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Perform the **core inventory operations** on an **in-memory** data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`add_item(inventory, item_name, quantity)`**  \n",
    "   - If `item_name` exists, decide whether to **add** to existing quantity or **reject** duplicates.  \n",
    "   - Return a **status** or boolean indicating success/failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`remove_item(inventory, item_name)`**  \n",
    "   - Remove the item if it exists.  \n",
    "   - If it doesn’t exist, decide whether to return `False` or do something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`update_quantity(inventory, item_name, new_qty)`**  \n",
    "   - Set the item’s quantity to `new_qty`.  \n",
    "   - If item doesn’t exist, decide whether to **create** it or **report an error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Discuss with your team if `inventory` is a `dict` or a `list of dicts`. E.g.:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Option A: dict\n",
    "  inventory = {\"Apple\": 10, \"Orange\": 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Option B: list of dicts\n",
    "  inventory = [\n",
    "      {\"name\": \"Apple\", \"quantity\": 10},\n",
    "      {\"name\": \"Orange\", \"quantity\": 5}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- In your test block, create a small `inventory` and call each function to see if it behaves as expected.  \n",
    "- **Optional Challenge**: Support partial updates or a “merge” strategy if the item already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module D: `search.py` (Student #4)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Provide **search & retrieval** within the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`search_item(inventory, search_term)`**  \n",
    "   - Return a list of items whose names **contain** `search_term`.  \n",
    "   - Consider **case-insensitive** matching by converting both the item name and search term to lowercase.  \n",
    "   - Example logic:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if search_term.lower() in item_name.lower():\n",
    "         # it's a match\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Return an **empty list** if there are no matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Test with examples:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # With a dict-based inventory:\n",
    "  # inventory = {\"Apple\": 10, \"Grapes\": 3, \"Paper\": 50}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # search_item(inventory, \"ap\") might find \"Apple\" and \"Paper\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Optional Challenge**: Let the user pick between partial or exact match.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module E: `stats.py` (Student #5)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Calculate **basic statistics** about the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`get_inventory_count(inventory)`**  \n",
    "   - Return how many **distinct items** are in the inventory (e.g., `len(inventory)` if it’s a dict).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`get_total_quantity(inventory)`**  \n",
    "   - Sum all item quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`get_top_item(inventory)`**  \n",
    "   - Return the **item with the highest quantity**.  \n",
    "   - Handle ties or empty inventory as you see fit (maybe return `None` or an empty string in those cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Be clear about your return type. If there’s a tie, do you return the first item? All items?  \n",
    "- Test with sample data:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "      mock_inv = {\"Apple\": 10, \"Orange\": 5}\n",
    "      print(get_inventory_count(mock_inv))  # Expect 2\n",
    "      print(get_total_quantity(mock_inv))   # Expect 15\n",
    "      print(get_top_item(mock_inv))         # Expect \"Apple\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Optional Challenge**: Add extra stats like “lowest quantity” or “average quantity.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module F: `persistence.py` (Student #6)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Manage **saving** and **loading** the inventory to/from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`save_inventory(inventory, filename=\"inventory_data.txt\")`**  \n",
    "   - Open the file in **write** mode.  \n",
    "   - Write out your inventory in the chosen format (plain text, CSV, or JSON).  \n",
    "   - Close the file (using a `with` statement ensures this automatically).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`load_inventory(filename=\"inventory_data.txt\")`**  \n",
    "   - Open the file in **read** mode.  \n",
    "   - Parse each line (or JSON) and reconstruct the inventory data structure.  \n",
    "   - If the file is missing or empty, handle gracefully (e.g., return an empty dict).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- **JSON approach** (easy if you’re using a dictionary):\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import json\n",
    "\n",
    "  with open(filename, \"w\") as f:\n",
    "      json.dump(inventory, f)\n",
    "\n",
    "  with open(filename, \"r\") as f:\n",
    "      inventory = json.load(f)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- If using **plain text**, store lines like `\"Apple,10\"` and split on commas.  \n",
    "- Test loading/saving with a small dictionary so you know it works.  \n",
    "- **Optional Challenge**: Handle file exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`) in a user-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module G: `main_app.py` (Student #7)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: **Orchestrate** all modules into a working **CLI** (Command Line Interface) app.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Application Startup**  \n",
    "   - Possibly call `load_inventory()` from `persistence.py` or create an empty inventory if the file doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Menu Loop**  \n",
    "   - Display menu options (1 to 8):  \n",
    "     1. Add item  \n",
    "     2. Remove item  \n",
    "     3. Update quantity  \n",
    "     4. Search items  \n",
    "     5. Show stats  \n",
    "     6. Save inventory  \n",
    "     7. Load inventory  \n",
    "     8. Exit  \n",
    "   - Use `input_manager.get_main_menu_choice()` to capture the user’s selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Action Handling**  \n",
    "   - Based on the menu choice, call the relevant functions from each module. For example:\n",
    "     - If user chooses “1” (Add item):\n",
    "       1. `item_name, qty = input_manager.get_item_details()`\n",
    "       2. `valid_name, name_msg = validator.validate_item_name(item_name)`\n",
    "       3. `valid_qty, qty_msg = validator.validate_quantity(qty)`\n",
    "       4. If both valid, `inventory_operations.add_item(...)`\n",
    "       5. Print success or error messages accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exit Condition**  \n",
    "   - Break out of the loop if the user selects “8”.  \n",
    "   - Optionally, confirm with the user before exiting (“Are you sure?”).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Messages**  \n",
    "   - If something fails (e.g., removing an item that doesn’t exist), decide whether to display a message or simply ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- This module is your **application’s “brain.”**  \n",
    "- Thoroughly test each menu option to ensure your integrated modules work together.  \n",
    "- **Optional Challenge**: Provide a more advanced menu system or submenus if you’d like.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Suggested Development Timeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Day 1**:  \n",
    "   - **Whole team meets** to outline function signatures and pick data structures.  \n",
    "   - One person creates the GitHub repo; everyone else **clones** it.  \n",
    "   - Each student creates a **feature branch** named after their module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Days 2 & 3**:  \n",
    "   - **Individual module development** (in your feature branches).  \n",
    "   - **PRs & code reviews** happen steadily; merges into main once modules are tested in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Day 4**:  \n",
    "   - **Integration** in `main_app.py`.  \n",
    "   - **Full testing & debugging** as a group.  \n",
    "   - Prepare for the group **presentation**.\n",
    "\n",
