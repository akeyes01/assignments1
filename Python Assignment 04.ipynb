    "# **Assignment 04: Build a YouTube Download Manager**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you’ll develop a **command-line YouTube Download Manager** using Python. By leveraging external libraries (such as **`pytube`** or others) and your prior knowledge of Python fundamentals, you’ll create a tool that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Downloads videos from YouTube via a **URL**.\n",
    "2. Offers **configurable options** (e.g., output folder, resolution).\n",
    "3. Provides **progress feedback** during downloads.\n",
    "4. **Gracefully handles errors** (invalid URLs, permission problems, connection failures, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to build a tool that can evolve over time—once the basics are in place, you can add more features (e.g., concurrency, a GUI, batch downloads). Although this project can be done **individually**, you are encouraged to continue using **Git** and best practices to manage your code base, document changes, and maintain a clean development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Detailed Guidance & Required Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Environment Setup & Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Virtual Environment**  \n",
    "   - Create and activate a dedicated **virtual environment**.  \n",
    "   - Example commands (not mandatory, just reference):  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python -m venv venv\n",
    "     source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux\n",
    "     venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install External Packages**  \n",
    "   - **`pytube`** (or alternative) for downloading YouTube videos.  \n",
    "   - **`tqdm`** for a progress bar (optional but highly recommended).  \n",
    "   - For **advanced** or optional features (concurrency, GUI, etc.), research additional packages as needed (`threading`, `asyncio`, `tkinter`, `PyQt`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Project Structure**  \n",
    "   - A typical **single-user** project might look like this:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     youtube_download_manager/\n",
    "       ├── main.py\n",
    "       ├── requirements.txt\n",
    "       ├── README.md\n",
    "       └── (other optional files or folders)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Keep your code organized so it’s easy to add new features later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Building the Command-Line Interface (CLI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Argument Parsing**  \n",
    "   - Use **`argparse`** or a similar library to handle command-line arguments.  \n",
    "   - **Required Argument**:  \n",
    "     - `--url`: The YouTube video URL to download.  \n",
    "   - **Optional Arguments** (with sensible defaults):  \n",
    "     - `--output`: The folder path to store the downloaded video (default: `\"downloads\"`).  \n",
    "     - `--resolution`: Desired resolution (e.g., `\"720p\"` or `\"1080p\"`). If not available, choose a fallback strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation & Error Messages**  \n",
    "   - Check if the provided URL is **plausibly** a YouTube link.  \n",
    "   - If the resolution is not found, either **auto-select** the best available or **prompt** the user.  \n",
    "   - Ensure the specified output folder exists (create it if it doesn’t).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User-Friendly Help & Usage**  \n",
    "   - Provide `--help` text explaining each argument and how to run the script.  \n",
    "   - Example usage:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python main.py --url \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...\" --output \"my_downloads\" --resolution \"1080p\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Downloading the Video**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `pytube` (or Alternative)**  \n",
    "   - `pytube` offers methods to select a **stream** (specific resolution, audio/video combination) and download it.  \n",
    "   - Familiarize yourself with the **`on_progress_callback`** feature to track progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting Resolution**  \n",
    "   - Filter the list of available streams:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     stream = yt.streams.filter(res=\"720p\", progressive=True).first()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - If the desired resolution doesn’t exist, decide whether to:\n",
    "     - Prompt the user for a different resolution.  \n",
    "     - Fallback to “best available.”  \n",
    "     - Return an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**  \n",
    "   - Use `try-except` around download operations to catch **network** or **permission** errors.  \n",
    "   - Provide a **clear message** if the download fails or is interrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Progress Feedback**  \n",
    "   - Implement at least a basic progress notification (e.g., “Downloading… 30%”).  \n",
    "   - Optionally integrate **`tqdm`** for a more polished progress bar or use `pytube`’s built-in callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Optional/Advanced Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re **confident** and want extra challenges, consider adding one or more of the following. Make sure you **document** these in your `README.md` if you implement them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple/Batch URL Downloads**  \n",
    "   - Accept multiple URLs (via command line or a file).  \n",
    "   - Download them **sequentially** or **in parallel** (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concurrency**  \n",
    "   - Use **threading** or **asyncio** to download multiple videos **simultaneously**.  \n",
    "   - Handle potential pitfalls (e.g., GIL in Python, rate limits, partial downloads, log collisions).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration File**  \n",
    "   - Store default parameters in `config.json` or `.yaml` (e.g., default resolution, output path).  \n",
    "   - Merge CLI arguments so they override the config file’s defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GUI**  \n",
    "   - For a more user-friendly approach, build a simple interface with **`tkinter`** or **`PyQt`**:\n",
    "     - Input field for the URL  \n",
    "     - Browse button for output folder  \n",
    "     - A progress indicator or bar  \n",
    "     - A “Download” button  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Logging & Tracking**  \n",
    "   - Log all download attempts (timestamp, URL, outcome) in a file like `downloads.log`.  \n",
    "   - Provide an option to **resume** incomplete downloads if the library supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Testing Your Program**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Valid URL**  \n",
    "   - Download a known YouTube video at a chosen resolution.  \n",
    "   - Check that the file appears in the correct folder, with correct naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invalid URL**  \n",
    "   - Pass in a malformed or random string.  \n",
    "   - Expect a graceful error message, not a crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Network Failures**  \n",
    "   - Temporarily disconnect your internet or throttle your connection to see how your script behaves mid-download.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Permission Issues**  \n",
    "   - Attempt to download to a restricted directory.  \n",
    "   - Confirm that the script handles these errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Batch/Concurrency Tests** (if implemented)  \n",
    "   - Provide multiple URLs, see if all or some of them complete successfully.  \n",
    "   - Verify no unexpected behavior arises from parallel downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **GUI Tests** (if implemented)  \n",
    "   - Enter valid/invalid URLs, watch the progress bar, confirm success or error messages appear as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Git Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this might be an **individual** assignment, continuing to use **Git** effectively is great practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Frequent Commits**  \n",
    "   - Commit after each major change or milestone (e.g., “Added basic CLI parsing,” “Integrated progress bar,” etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Branches**  \n",
    "   - If you plan to add concurrency or a GUI, create a dedicated feature branch like `feature/concurrency`.  \n",
    "   - Merge back to `main` only after stable testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detailed Commit Messages**  \n",
    "   - Helps you (and potential collaborators) track changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tagging or Releasing**  \n",
    "   - Optionally create tags like `v1.0` when you reach a working milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Grading Criteria**\n",
