    "\n",
    "### **1. Understanding the Internet’s Evolution and Its Impact**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “Many aspects of modern API design can be traced back to the **core principles** that guided the early development of the internet. Can you explain how **openness** and **standardization** (e.g., the adoption of TCP/IP, DNS) continue to shape decisions you make when building or consuming REST APIs in Django or any other framework?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- The historical roots of the internet (ARPANET, TCP/IP, DNS).  \n",
    "- Why open standards matter for RESTful design and interoperability.  \n",
    "- Connection to how Django (or DRF) structures endpoints, status codes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. OSI Model in Troubleshooting**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “Imagine you have a Django-based service deployed in the cloud, and users occasionally can’t reach your API endpoint. If you were asked to pinpoint potential issues using the **OSI model**, how would you methodically approach diagnosing where the failure might lie?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- Layers (Physical, Network, Transport, Application) in simplified or full OSI form.  \n",
    "- Practical troubleshooting steps at each relevant layer.  \n",
    "- How it ties back to HTTP (Application layer) and potential server or network misconfigurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. HTTP vs. HTTPS and Status Codes**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “A major part of backend work is **securing APIs** and sending back proper **HTTP status codes**. In Django REST Framework, how would you ensure **HTTPS** is enforced, and how would you decide which **HTTP status code** to return for each of the following situations:  \n",
    "> 1) A newly created resource.  \n",
    "> 2) An invalid request payload from the client.  \n",
    "> 3) Server-side failure you can’t fully disclose.  \n",
    "> 4) A request to partially modify a resource?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- The difference between HTTP and HTTPS, plus how to enforce HTTPS in a Django/DRF context (e.g., reverse proxy, SSL settings).  \n",
    "- Proper use of codes like **201**, **400**, **500**, and **PATCH** with relevant status codes (e.g., 200 or 204).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. DevOps Principles in a Backend Python Workflow**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “Describe a scenario in which having a **CI/CD pipeline** (with Docker images for your Django app) and **collaborative DevOps practices** drastically reduces deployment downtime. What specific steps or tools might you use to automate testing and deployment for a Python-based backend?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- CI/CD pipeline fundamentals (e.g., Git hooks, automated tests, Docker packaging).  \n",
    "- Load balancing / rolling updates / integration with something like Kubernetes or AWS.  \n",
    "- How DevOps culture (communication, shared ownership) speeds up delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Python 2 vs. Python 3: Practical Differences**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “Python 2 has been retired, but sometimes we still encounter legacy code. Can you name **two** Python 3 features that break backward compatibility with Python 2, and provide a brief code snippet illustrating a scenario that would fail on Python 2 but succeed on Python 3?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- Examples: `print()` function vs. statement, Unicode string handling, `range` vs. `xrange`, integer division behavior.  \n",
    "- Clear, concise code snippet demonstrating an incompatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. The GIL and Its Implications**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “In your experience, how does Python’s **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** affect your approach to writing concurrent or parallel code for CPU-bound tasks in a Django backend? Can you give an example where the GIL might **not** pose a performance issue, and another scenario where you’d work around it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- GIL’s effect on multi-threaded CPU-bound code.  \n",
    "- I/O-bound concurrency vs. CPU-bound concurrency.  \n",
    "- Potential solutions: `multiprocessing`, using native extensions (NumPy), or using an asynchronous approach (`asyncio`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Packaging Python Applications and Dependencies**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “Your Django REST Framework project relies on a few external libraries (e.g., `requests`, `psycopg2`). What are some **best practices** for managing dependencies in Python, and how would you ensure the **same environment** is replicated in production or in Docker containers?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- Virtual environments (`venv` or `conda`).  \n",
    "- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.  \n",
    "- Docker best practices for reproducible builds (e.g., using pinned versions, multi-stage builds).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Code Review Exercise: Whitespace and Indentation Errors**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “Look at the following code snippet. It’s meant to iterate over a list of numbers, print all even ones, and stop printing as soon as it hits a number greater than 10. Identify any **indentation** or **logic issues** and provide a corrected version.”\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_evens_stop(numbers):\n",
    "for n in numbers:\n",
    "if n % 2 == 0:\n",
    "print(n)\n",
    "  if n > 10:\n",
    "break\n",
    "print(\"Done\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- Understanding how indentation enforces code blocks in Python.  \n",
    "- Possibly noticing that the `print(\"Done\")` might need correct indentation to print only once or after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Basic Python Error Handling and File I/O**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “You have a function in Python that reads configuration data from a file and returns it as a dictionary. How would you handle **file-not-found errors** gracefully, and what Python language features make it easy to ensure that files are always closed properly?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- Using `try/except` for file-related errors (`FileNotFoundError`).  \n",
    "- `with open(...) as f:` context managers for safe file operations.  \n",
    "- Possibly returning an empty dict or raising a custom exception if the file is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Realistic Scenario: Deploying a Small DRF Project**\n",
    "**Interview-Like Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “You’ve built a minimal Django REST Framework API locally. Now you want to **containerize** it using Docker and eventually deploy it on a **Kubernetes** cluster. Could you walk me through the **essential steps** from creating a Dockerfile to setting up a simple Deployment on Kubernetes? Focus on how you handle environment variables (like DB credentials) and mention any considerations from Module 00 about ensuring high availability.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts to Address:**  \n",
    "- Outline Dockerfile structure (FROM python:3.XX, installing dependencies, copying code, etc.).  \n",
    "- The concept of a Kubernetes Deployment, Service, possibly an Ingress.  \n",
    "- Storing credentials in environment variables or Kubernetes Secrets.  \n",
    "- Load balancing and health checks for high availability.\n",
